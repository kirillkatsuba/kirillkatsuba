## üîç Profile
Hi there! I am highly motivated and well-trained reasercher and machine learning specialist. Most of time I been working with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and making some publications in the sphere. Now I am deep dive into NLP and CV and developing project which combine this tecniques.
